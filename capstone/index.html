                <h2>Testimonials</h2>
                <p>“Wasatch Tax and Neala Patten have been an integral part of our lives for 25 years. My husband and I have very complex business structures and Neala has always been a huge part in the decision making process with our construction, property management, leasing, and collision repair businesses. She also works extremely well with the rest of our trust and financial partners to ensure that we make the best decisions possible. She helped us through the sale of a large business a few years ago, it was very complicated and it really helped knowing that Wasatch Tax is always up to date on current tax implications and code. I know she always has our best interest at heart and I cannot imagine having to entrust our business and personal taxes to anyone else!”
                <br><br>
                —Shannon Valdez
                </p>
                <p>“I have had Wasatch Tax Firm assist my company, Oak Canyon Concrete, since 2001. They have also done my personal taxes and tax preparation for various LLCs. Definitely one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.”
                <br><br>
                —Shane Richins <br> Heber, UT
                </p>
                <p>“We started working with Wasatch Tax six years ago, when the accountant we were using was not providing adequate representation in a three-year audit of our business.  Wasatch Tax stepped in and took over, and with extensive knowledge and experience; properly and aggressively negotiated and advocated in our behalf and saved our company tens of thousands of dollars.
                <br><br>
                “We have continued to work with Wasatch Tax since then.  Their knowledge, professionalism, and responsiveness is reassuring.  They have a committed interest in helping us accurately and confidentially stay in compliance, while not overpaying taxes.”
                <br><br>
                —Nationwide Trailer & Equipment Sales <br> Lehi, UT
                </p>
                <p>“Neala Patten has done my personal and business tax preparation for the past 25 years. Neala is without question the most knowledgeable professional I have ever met regarding tax preparation and tax counseling. I have owned a paint business in the past and currently own a used car dealership in Payson named Robert Marsh Car & Truck Sales. I also have a small farm. As a business owner my focus is on the day to day demands and growth of the business. I have very little time to deal with tax matters required for any business . For this reason I use Wasatch Tax & Accounting. If someone were to ask me where to go for tax prep regardless of the type of business.  I would recommend Neala and her staff at Wasatch Tax and do so with the highest level of trust and confidence.”
                <br><br>
                —Robert Marsh, Marsh Auto <br> Payson, UT
                </p>
                <p>“Neala and the entire team at Wasatch Tax are the very best in the business. They are always prompt to answer questions, very professional and knowledgeable, and you can’t beat the value of their fees.  When they say, “My tax lady rocks!”, it’s 100% truth.”
